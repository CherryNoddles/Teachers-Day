  # *Final Boss*
  ## "Ok! That's it for today. I'll see you later for assembly." Ms Low called out as the bell rang. "Thank you and goodbye, Ms Low." The usual monotonous line rang out through the classroom, but half the class wasn't even paying attention at this point. The moment the bell rang, everyone had already whipped out their handphones. "Once the bell rings, it's always handphone, handphone, handphone... All the Year 1s have a handphone addiction, is it?" Ms Low shook her head, obvious disappointment on her face. "Yeah. But at least better than cocaine or something, right?" Chen Ze replied, earning the laughs of his classmates. With one last shake of her head, Ms Low stepped out of their classroom, leaving the class to its antics. 
  ### "Huh? Where are we?" Chern Xi asked, looking around at the foreign world. Tall blocks of stone surrounded the group. It was like they were stuck in a maze. "Forget where we are! Look at what we're wearing!" Clarissa shouted. Everyone looked down at their clothes, and only then did they realise that they were no longer wearing their white school uniform, but colourful costumes that looked awfully familiar to a few of them. "What the hell..." Can Ran said. 
  #### "Huh? What? What's going on? Guys?" Joshua murmured sleepily, eyes half open. "Joshua! Look down! Look at your phone! Victor screamed, waving his arms around wildly. "Huh?" Joshua glanced down and blinked a couple times. "Guys? Is that you?" Joshua asked unsurely. "Yes! We got pulled into the game, for some reason! Who are you controlling?!" Charlotte called out, trying to get Joshua's attention. "Huh? All right... Let's find out..." Joshua replied sleepily. He picked up his phone, shaking everyone off their feet. "Oi Joshua! Be careful!" Chern Xi yelled, scrambling to regain his balance. "Oh. Sorry." Joshua said, steadying his hands. The world stopped shaking, and everyone slowly got to their feet.
##### "Try to see who you can move around!" Hayley said. "All right... Let's see..." Joshua muttered, placing his thumbs where the controllers were supposed to be. Everyone braced themselves for potential impact. Joshua slid his thumb across the screen, and... Charlotte went flying straight into a block of stone. "Charlotte! Are you okay?" Wynne raced over to Charlotte and helped her up. "Ouch... That hurts..." Charlotte muttered.
